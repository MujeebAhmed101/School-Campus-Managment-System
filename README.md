# School-Campus-Managment-System

This project is a Small School Campus Network Infrastructure designed and implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer. It was developed as part of a Computer Networks course project to simulate a fully functional and secure school network.

## Project Overview

The School Campus Management System represents a realistic network topology tailored for an educational institution. The network consists of multiple departments, administrative offices, computer labs, and a server room â€” all connected using industry-standard networking protocols and devices.

## Tools & Technologies

- Cisco Packet Tracer (Network Simulation)
- Routers, Switches, PCs, Servers, and Wireless Devices
- VLANs, IP Addressing, DHCP, DNS
- Static and Dynamic Routing (e.g., RIP/OSPF)
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Network Security Basics

---

##  Features Implemented

- ðŸ”Œ **Logical Topology**:
  - Separated networks for each department (e.g., Admin, Teachers, Students, Library)
  - Backbone router and core switches to manage interconnectivity
-  **IP Addressing Scheme**:
  - Subnetting implemented to allocate IPs efficiently across departments
  - Private addressing with NAT (optional)
-  **Network Security**:
  - ACLs to restrict access between departments
  - Firewall simulation for internet access control
-  **Wireless Access**:
  - Wireless routers/access points for student & teacher devices
-  **Server Configuration**:
  - DNS Server for hostname resolution
  - DHCP Server for dynamic IP allocation
  - File/Email/FTP server simulation (optional if implemented)

##  How to Run

1. Open the project file (`.pkt`) using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. Explore the topology and inspect device configurations.
3. Simulate pings or data transfers to verify connectivity.
4. Modify or extend the network as needed for experimentation.
